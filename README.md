🔹 Terminal Execution
This image shows the Python application running without errors.  
The system starts multiple processes, listens for the hotword, and waits for user voice input.
🔹 Voice Command in Action
After detecting the hotword, the assistant successfully recognizes the spoken command  
**“open YouTube”** and automatically opens YouTube in the browser.

✅ Key Highlights
- Hotword detection working correctly  
- Speech recognition executed in real time  
- Voice command mapped to system action  
- Multi-processing used for parallel execution  
- Tested and verified on Windows OS  

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Speech Recognition  
- Multiprocessing  
- OS Automation  
- Text-to-Speech  

 📌 Note
This project was developed as a **university mini-project** and executed successfully with live voice input.  
Further improvements like GUI enhancement and additional commands can be added in future versions.
